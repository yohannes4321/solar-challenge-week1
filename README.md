 Deployment to Streamlit Community Cloud
Steps:

    Push the complete project to GitHub.

    Go to Streamlit Community Cloud.

    Sign in and click “New App”.

    Connect to your GitHub repo, choose app/main.py as the entry point.

    Click “Deploy”.

Ensure:

    data/ is present in the repo.

    requirements.txt is in the root.

    No hardcoded local paths (../)—use relative paths within repo root.

✅ KPIs Check
KPI	Implementation
Usability	Clean layout, dropdown for metric selection, readable visuals
Interactive Elements	Dropdown (selectbox) for choosing metrics
Visual Appeal	Professional Seaborn/Matplotlib plots, consistent spacing and titles
Deployment	Deployable with minimal setup (via Streamlit Cloud using main.py)

Would you like me to generate a downloadable .zip folder with all files ready for deployment, or help you deploy it live?

Here's a professional, complete README.md for your Streamlit solar dashboard project. It includes sections for project overview, setup, usage, features, and deployment:

# ☀️ Solar Radiation Comparison Dashboard

An interactive Streamlit dashboard to compare solar energy potential across **Benin**, **Sierra Leone**, and **Togo** using key radiation metrics: **GHI** (Global Horizontal Irradiance), **DNI** (Direct Normal Irradiance), and **DHI** (Diffuse Horizontal Irradiance).

This project was developed as part of the **MoonLight Energy Solutions – Solar Challenge**, and provides valuable insights into the relative solar potential of each country.

---

## 🔍 Features

- 📊 **Boxplots** comparing GHI, DNI, and DHI across all three countries
- 📈 **Summary statistics table** (mean, median, standard deviation)
- 🌍 **Country ranking chart** for average GHI
- 🧠 **Interactive UI** using Streamlit widgets
- ☁️ **Cloud-deployable** on Streamlit Community Cloud

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/solar-dashboard.git
cd solar-dashboard

2. Install Dependencies

Make sure you have Python 3.8+ and then install the required packages:

pip install -r requirements.txt

3. Run the App Locally

streamlit run app/main.py

Open your browser and go to: http://localhost:8501
🌐 Deployment (Streamlit Community Cloud)

To deploy:

    Push this repo to GitHub

    Visit Streamlit Community Cloud

    Click “New app”

    Connect your GitHub repo

    Set the main file path to app/main.py

    Click Deploy

Your app will be live at a public URL!
📊 Solar Metrics Explained

    GHI – Total solar radiation received per unit area (best overall solar potential indicator)

    DNI – Direct beam radiation (important for concentrated solar tech)

    DHI – Diffused radiation from the atmosphere (useful for PV in cloudy areas)

✅ Key Insights Example

    Sierra Leone shows the highest median GHI but also higher variability.

    Benin has consistently lower DNI, suggesting weaker direct irradiance.

    Togo displays the most stable DHI across the year.
